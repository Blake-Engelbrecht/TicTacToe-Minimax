# TicTacToe-Minimax

Python implementation of a "Minimax" algorithm. Used to create an A.I. bot that is unbeatable at Tic-Tac-Toe.

Game allows player to choose difficulty and move order. (easy or hard and X or O) 

Easy mode is played against a dumbBot that makes moves at random. 

Hard mode is played against an A.I. bot
that uses the minimax algorithm to analyze all possible moves and choose the best one.

X's always make the first move.

## Problem Statement
The purpose of this project is to create an AI program that can skillfully play
TicTacToe. Tic-tac-toe is a board game for two players, X and O, who take turns
marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of
their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
