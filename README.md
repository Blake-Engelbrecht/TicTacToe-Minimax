# TicTacToe-Minimax

Python implementation of a "Minimax" algorithm. Used to create an A.I. bot that is unbeatable at Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Problem Statement
The purpose of this project is to create an AI program that can skillfully play
TicTacToe. Tic-tac-toe is a board game for two players, X and O, who take turns
marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of
their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
